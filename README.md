# Scientific Baking

## About the app
A few months ago I startet learning how to develop web pages and apps in a professional manner. In order to complete the course I was asked to build an own app until the end of June 2019.

Besides of my passion for technical things (web development, aircraft, photography) I love to bake. As I am often discussing the degree of difficulty when people are enjoing my cakes, cookies and chocolates, I decided to show that everyone is able to make such things. It only requires the most detailed instructions you can imagine. They need to be as exact as science.

To make baking even more exiting I am experimenting a lot with ingredients and styles of diets. But my main criterion for every recipe is to use only natural ingredients. That is why I never add artificial flavours, colours, etc.
